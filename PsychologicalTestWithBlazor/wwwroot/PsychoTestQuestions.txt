I am nervous about things that did not bother me before
I do not enjoy eating and have a poor appetite
Despite the help of friends and family members, I can't get rid of my feelings of sadness
I feel that I am not worse than others
I find it hard to concentrate on what I have to do
I feel overwhelmed
Everything I do requires extra effort from me
I hope for a good future
I feel like my life is not going well
I feel anxious, afraid
I have a bad night's sleep
I feel like a happy person
It seems that I have become less talkative
I am worried about feeling lonely
People around me are unfriendly to me
